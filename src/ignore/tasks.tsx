              The <i>Transactions</i> table, under the {" "}

              To make it easier to see what transactions are sent to Russia, we would like to be able to filter on the  <b>Recipients country</b>. 
              <br />

              Your task is to implement a way to filter on the <b>Recipients country</b>, 
              in the same way as is done for <b>Senders country</b>.
              <br />
              <br />
              Have a look in the file <code className="dnb-code">
                Transactions.tsx
              </code> in the <code className="dnb-code">Assignment3</code>-folder, find the

              On the <i>Customer page </i> we have a list over all accounts belonging to this customer. If you click on one of the account names, you will see an overview of all the transactions connected to this account.

              We would also like to be able to click on the account number and be directed to this same overview. To be able to do this we would have to change the element that contains the account number from

              <br />
              The <code className="dnb-code">getTransactionLink</code>

              </code>{" "}
              function so that you can click on the account number and get to the list over all transactions for that account. For inspiration, have a look at how the function is used with account name.
